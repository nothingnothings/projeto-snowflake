 The session in a worksheet
  is typically closed in the
   following scenarios:

Idle Timeout: If a user's
 session remains idle (no activity) 
 for a specific period, Snowflake's 
 GUI automatically closes the session to
  conserve resources. The default idle 
  timeout for Snowflake is 60 minutes, but it
   can be customized by the account administrator.


Browser Tab Closure: If the user closes the
 browser tab or navigates away from the 
 worksheet, the session will be terminated.

Explicit Termination: Users can
 manually terminate their sessions 
  logging out or using the "Terminate" 
  option within the Snowflake web interface.

It's essential to be aware of these
 automatic session termination mechanisms 
 to avoid unexpected data loss or disruptions. 
 Please note that the GUI's features and behavior 
 might have evolved since my last update, so I
  recommend checking Snowflake's official 
  documentation or release notes for the most 
  up-to-date information.
