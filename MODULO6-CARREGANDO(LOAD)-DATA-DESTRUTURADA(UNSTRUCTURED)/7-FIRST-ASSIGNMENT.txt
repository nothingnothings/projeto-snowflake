1. Query from the previously created JSON_RAW  table.

Note: This table was created in the previous assignment (assignment 7) where you had to create a stage object that is pointing to 's3://snowflake-assignments-mc/unstructureddata/'. We have called the table JSON_RAW.







2. Select the attributes

first_name

last_name

skills

and query these columns.



2. The skills column contains an array. Query the first two values in the skills attribute for every record in a separate column:

first_name

last_name

skills_1

skills_2



3. Create a table and insert the data for these 4 columns in that table.
