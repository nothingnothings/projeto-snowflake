In Snowflake, you can create different roles with different levels of permissions and assign them to users. Some common roles include SYSADMIN, SECURITYADMIN, ACCOUNTADMIN, PUBLIC, and more. Each role has specific privileges that control what actions users assigned to those roles can perform within the Snowflake environment.

It's possible that 
the term "Snowflake reader accounts" may 
refer to a specific use case where you create
 a separate role with read-only permissions. 
 These reader accounts are typically given 
 to users or applications that only require 
 access to read data without the
  ability to modify or write data in
   the Snowflake database. This
    approach is useful for scenarios
     where you want to provide data access
      to a broader audience without the risk of
       accidental data modifications.
