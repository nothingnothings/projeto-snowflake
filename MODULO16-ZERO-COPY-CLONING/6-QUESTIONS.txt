Pergunta 1:
If we clone a table that uses 20GB of storage and make no changes on it we afterwards have to pay 40GB of storage for both tables. True or false?





FALSE. ...




For databases, schemas, and tables, a clone does 
not contribute to the overall data storage for the
 object until operations are performed on

 the clone that modify existing data or add new data.


 Pergunta 3:
If we make changes made to the source object this will 
be reflected/updated in the clone object as well. True or false?





FALSE





A clone is an independent object. Therefore if
 we update the source object this will not be reflected in the clone.













 Pergunta 4:
If we clone a table this clone will also contain
 the data of the source table from the moment it has been cloned -
  even though no additional storage is needed
   for the initial clone. True or false?






TRUE




Yes even though it is only a meta data 
operation and the underlaying data will not be 
clone the table will contain the data.
