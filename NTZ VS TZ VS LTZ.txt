There are 3 different timestamp types in Snowflake:

TIMESTAMP_NTZ
TIMESTAMP_TZ
TIMESTAMP_LTZ


TIMESTAMP_NTZ (Timestamp with No Timezone) is the datatype 
for timestamps without a timezone
 (ntz = no time zone). This is also referred to as “walltime”
  as it is the time you would get by looking at a random clock on the
   wall and writing it down







TIMESTAMP_TZ (Timestamp with Timezone):

It is the datatype for timestamps with timezones
 (tz = time zone). Annoyingly,
Snowflake does *not* store the timezone
associated with this timestamp. 
Instead, it stores the  -------UTC offset-------
associated with the timezone associated with this timestamp.


UTC OFFSET --> COISAS COMO ""-0400"", ""-0700"", ""+0300""






TIMESTAMP_LTZ (Timestamp with Local Timezone):





Snowflake uses TIMESTAMP_LTZ for
timestamps with timezones
in the current session timezone 
(LTZ = local time zone). Ideally, 
this would make consumers automatically work 
with timestamps in their own local timezone.
 SQL code interacting with TIMESTAMP_LTZ datatypes will not be deterministic.
